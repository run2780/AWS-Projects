 # Build a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
                                                                                    
In this project, I will demonstrate how to create a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), create a Subnet and an Internet gateway. I'm doing this project to learn and dive into the core of AWS networking by creating my very own VPC.

What is Amazon VPC?
A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is like your own private space inside AWS. In this space, you can set up and run AWS resources in a network that you control. The main idea is that it’s separate and secure, so your resources don’t mix with others.
In today's project, I created AWS to create my VPC along with Subnet and Internet gateway to demonstrate my learnings in building VPC

Personal reflection
This project took me around 35 minutes including documentation after understanding the concepts of IPV4, CIDR blocks, Subnets and Internet gateway.
