Over the next 9 projects, you'll go from having zero experience in networking to building a complete virtual private cloud (VPC), which forms the backbone of secure and scalable cloud applications. You'll gain practical networking skills that are in high demand across the tech and cloud industry.

By the end of this series, you'll have:

* Built a secure VPC architecture from scratch
* Connected resources across different network environments
* Implemented network security and monitoring
* Build your networking architecture through these 9 connected projects
